Maze Testing:

	A few of the mazes used for testing have been included in the docs folder.
	The program has been tested to operate on mazes with zero, one, or
	multiple solutions. Multiple starts are valid but multiple endings may
	cause a printing error.
	All known limitations will (potentially) cause errors but all have been
	tested to be safely handled and prevent any undefined behaviours.

Stack Testing:

	Functions have been tested for correctness of functionality with any valid
	inputs and correctness of error handling. Any hidden post conditions, ie.
	memory freeing, have been tested manually through valgrind.
